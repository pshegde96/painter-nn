This is a re-implementation of [Neural Network "paints" and Image](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/image_regression.html) in TensorFlow.

The neural network is trained on a single image. It accepts the pixel position as input and trains a neural network to output the RGB value of the pixel. Since this NN tries to learn to paint a single image, overfitting is good!
